# UK School League Tables

A single-page ranking of every mainstream primary and secondary school in
England, computed from the Department for Education's annual performance
tables. The page is fully self-contained: open `index.html` in any browser
(including straight from the file system) and it works — no server, no build
step, no dependencies.

Coverage: **4,067 secondary** (KS4) and **15,056 primary** (KS2) schools.
Quick filters for Greater Manchester (10 boroughs) and Greater London (33
boroughs), plus an "All England" view; instant search by school name across
the full national dataset.

## Repository contents

| Path                              | Purpose                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.html`                      | The app. Fetches the active year's data at runtime via a year selector.      |
| `build_data.py`                   | Pre-processor — turns a year's DfE CSVs into `secondary.json` / `primary.json`. |
| `england_ks4final.csv`            | DfE raw secondary (KS4) table for the latest year (2024-2025), at repo root. |
| `england_ks2final.csv`            | DfE raw primary (KS2) table for the latest year (2024-2025), at repo root.   |
| `data/<year>/secondary.json`      | Generated secondary dataset the page fetches for that academic year.         |
| `data/<year>/primary.json`        | Generated primary dataset the page fetches for that academic year.           |
| `data/<year>/england_ks*.csv`     | DfE raw CSVs for earlier years (e.g. `data/2023-2024/`).                      |

Academic years currently built: **2024-2025** and **2023-2024**, switchable
from the **Academic year** dropdown above the league table.

## Running the app

The page **fetches** `data/<year>/{secondary,primary}.json`, so it must be
served over http(s) — opening the file directly from disk will fail on the
fetch.

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000   # then visit http://localhost:8000/
```

Deployed on GitHub Pages it works as-is. No build step or dependencies at
runtime — just static files.

---

## Updating / adding a year with `build_data.py`

Run this when the source DfE CSVs change (typically once a year, when new
performance tables are published) or to add an earlier year.

```sh
# Latest year — CSVs at repo root -> data/2024-2025/
python3 build_data.py . data/2024-2025

# An earlier year — CSVs in a folder; OUT_DIR defaults to that folder
python3 build_data.py data/2023-2024
```

Each `data/<year>/` folder holds that year's `england_ks4final.csv` +
`england_ks2final.csv` and the generated `secondary.json` / `primary.json`.
To expose a new year in the UI, add it to `YEAR_RESULTS` / `YEAR_LABELS` and
the `#yearSelect` options in `index.html`.

What it does:

1. **Reads** `england_ks4final.csv` and `england_ks2final.csv` from `SRC_DIR`.
2. **Filters** to mainstream schools (`RECTYPE == '1'`) with valid scores in
   every input metric. Suppression markers (`SUPP`, `NE`, `NP`, `..`) are
   treated as missing and drop the row.
3. **Classifies** each school: Grammar (selective admissions), Independent
   (private), or Non-selective; appends gender (Boys/Girls) and religious
   affiliation (RC/CofE/Jewish/Muslim/Hindu/Sikh/Methodist/Quaker) where
   present.
4. **Maps** the DfE LEA code to a borough/area name and tags Greater
   Manchester / Greater London / other.
5. **Computes** the ranking scores (see *Ranking algorithms* below), including
   national percentiles and within-LA percentiles for the primary indices.
6. **Writes** `secondary.json` + `primary.json` into `OUT_DIR`.

Requirements: Python 3 stdlib only. No `pip install` needed.

## Ranking algorithms

### Secondary — School Quality Score (SQS)

A single 0–∞ composite score where **100 = exactly the England average**.
Numbers above 100 mean above-average performance, scaled linearly.

```
SQS = (A8_norm     × 0.35)
    + (EM_norm     × 0.30)
    + (EBaccAPS_norm × 0.20)
    + (EBaccEnt_norm × 0.15)

where each _norm = (School value / England average) × 100
```

England averages used (DfE-published, 2024/25 data year):

| Metric       | England avg |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Attainment 8 | 46.1        |
| Grade 5+ Eng & Maths | 45.4% |
| EBacc APS    | 4.09        |
| EBacc Entry  | 40.5%       |

Interpretation bands:

| SQS range  | Meaning            |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| 180+       | Exceptional        |
| 160–179    | Outstanding        |
| 140–159    | Well above average |
| 120–139    | Above average      |
| < 120      | Near / below avg   |

### Primary — three percentile indices

KS2 doesn't have a single headline metric, so the page offers **three
different rankings**, selected via the "Rank by" dropdown. Each is scored
on a 0–100 scale where the England average sits around 49.

Inputs are **national percentiles** (rank against all ~15,000 England
primaries, midrank handling for ties): a percentile of 75 means the school
is ahead of 75% of primaries on that measure.

Inputs are RWM-expected, RWM-higher, **English** and maths. Because reading
and **GPS (grammar, punctuation & spelling)** are both English-domain, their
percentiles are averaged into one `English%ile = (Reading%ile + GPS%ile) / 2`,
kept balanced 1:1 with maths.

```
API (Academic Performance Index — default)
  = (Expected%ile × 0.40) + (Higher%ile × 0.40)
  + (English%ile × 0.10) + (Maths%ile × 0.10)

GRI (Grammar School Readiness)
  = (Higher%ile × 0.50) + (English%ile × 0.25) + (Maths%ile × 0.25)

11+ Readiness (within the school's own Local Authority)
  = (Higher_LA × 0.50) + (English_LA × 0.25) + (Maths_LA × 0.25)
```

For 11+, each input is a **percentile rank 0–100 within the LA** instead of
nationally — so it measures standing among local peers and, unlike min-max,
isn't distorted by a single outlier school. A solo-school LA falls back to a
neutral 50.

Interpretation bands (apply to API / GRI / 11+ identically):

| Score range | Meaning            |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 80+         | Top tier           |
| 65–79       | Well above average |
| 50–64       | Above average      |
| 35–49       | Around / below avg |
| < 35        | Lower tier         |

## Reading the data columns

Every row in either table carries: school name, area (borough or town),
school type (e.g. "Grammar · Boys (CofE)"), the ranking score badge, and
four metric columns specific to the phase.

### Secondary table

The CSV files in this repo are the published 2024/25 datasets (released in
the 2025 performance tables cycle). All percentile ranks and league
standings are computed against that snapshot.
